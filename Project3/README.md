"Civitus"


I've always wanted to attempt making a Civilization-type game - citybuilding, growing borders, and so forth. This seemed as good a time as any
to try my hand at it. I've felt during the course that HTML and jQuery are weaknesses of mine, and that I somewhat dislike working with them because of it -
 and for exactly that reason, I decided to do the project using HTML, jQuery, and jQuery UI, as well as Howler.js for audio.

 It turned out to be quite difficult to figure out what exactly the game would be and how it would play. For most of the development time,
 I was struggling with HTML and jQuery, and on multiple occasions, I was tearing out my hair and my beard trying to wrap my head around it.
 There was a bit of a light in the end of the tunnel, however, when we covered JSONs and when I was told of the data() function -
  and while it took a while to fully realise that potential, towards the last weeks of development I had a clear idea of how the game would work.

  Major inspiration was taken from Civilization, Age of Empires, and Tiny Islands - city/empire building was to take center stage. Due to the timeframe and
  circumstances, I decided to skip turn mechanics as well as AI and combat, but I generally favor more peaceful sessions of the aforementioned games anyway,
  so I decided to keep that preference while designing Civitus.

The game works with two resources - I've always enjoyed systems that keep things simple - which the player uses to build different structures and gain
either of those resources. Originally, the game was a bit more modern (Whales were originally Oil) but towards the end of development, while
doing all the art assets, I opted for a more Medieval theme. All the original art was placeholder emojis, which was replaced by hand-drawn gifs, done with ProCreate on an iPad Pro.
The medieval theme was reflected, too, in the audio for the game - most of which was borrowed from
the aforementioned franchises. The music tracks are themes from Civilization VI, for example.

I'm happy to say that my jQuery and general understanding of HTML and CSS has increased tenfold. I tend to have few issues with understanding programming languages such as
Javascript or C#, but HTML and its usual gang of accomplices has always been troublesome for me - until now. There's still much to learn, but I feel like I've improved, which feels fantastic.
I made a conscious decision to avoid any and all pre-written code, so all code in Civitus was written by me from the ground up, based on APIs and Docs for the various libraries used.
(Chrome's inspect tool has also proven to be invaluable for CSS.)

That's not to say that I think the code is without fault, however - There are certainly instances where I know I could speed it up or make it more efficient. Some of those parts
are left untouched simply due to lack of knowledge or inventive thinking, but there are others, such as the build functions, where I technically could simplify the code or create a universal function.
Considering the circumstances of development, however, I've opted to try to keep having fun while programming, and a part of me prefers easily legible, single-function code. In this game, at least.

I'm very proud of Civitus. It's not a very spectacular game, but it has a slow appeal that I really enjoy. The name Civitus is also pretty good, if I do say so myself. The initial frustration
eventually gave up, and I had a great time creating the game. I might even continue its development over the Summer, while I take breaks from other projects I'm working on.
