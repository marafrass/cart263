PROJECT ONE - “Boulder”

Martin Hanses - Artist’s Statement

I’d been wanting to do a sort of text-based adventure or narrative game since I first learnt basic HTML, and this project seemed to be the perfect storm for it. I’m not very proficient nor, honestly, interested in jQuery, but it proved to be an excellent toolset for the kind of game I wanted to create. 

   The main mechanic of progression is fairly simple - using javascript to progress a variable that updates the text box and triggers events based on its value - so I wanted to make sure the other elements of design made the game feel like a more complete experience. The design of the text box was influenced by dialogue in games like Disco Elysium and Shadowrun, and I think the short lines of text stacked more vertically than horizontally makes the dialogue more readable and digestible.

   Initially, I toyed around with exploring the theme through looping mechanics - infinite text boxes, resetting positions, etc. I found that while a game like that would be thematically appropriate with the surface story of the myth, it didn’t inspire me. The essence of the myth of Sisophys is a task that can’t be finished; endlessly attempting the impossible. Another aspect I liked in the story is the two characters - Sisophys and the Boulder. Sure, there are other, I’d say external characters, like Zeus, but the core of the myth is Sisophys pushing a boulder that can not be pushed to the peak. Sisophys is essentially in an abusive relationship with the boulder. 

   Since the boulder hasn’t (as far as we know) got a will of its own, it’s sort of ambiguous which party is the abusive one - either the boulder is forcing its will upon Sisophys, passively rolling down the hill, or Sisophys is forcing its will upon the boulder, forcing it towards the peak, working against its natural state. So the narrative evolved out of that; Sisophys isn’t forced to push the boulder up the hill by anyone but himself and his pride. The boulder is passive, but isn’t above placing the blame on Sisophys and tearing him down - either with words or by rolling down.

   Originally, the game was supposed to have a beginning and an end - a sort of condensed look into the life of Sisophys. I decided against that fairly early on, however, as it felt like a missed opportunity to reinforce the loop that Sisophys is stuck in. The player will reach the “end”, but is then thrown back to an earlier part of the game. The same hopelessness and inability to break the cycle is reflected in the dialogue choices: while the responses will differ, no matter what you say or think, you’re stuck in the situation until you actually exit the game.

   The look of the game ended up being centered around the artwork of the boulder, which is supposed to evoke a feeling of being trapped, screaming and in pain. While the audio of the wind, the boulder, and the click are very clear representations of their correlating object, I tried to find a balance between minor and major melodies with the music. It kicks in a short while into the game, and then keeps looping. It doesn’t build up to a chorus or finale, but rather lingers and wanders aimlessly, hopefully reinforcing the theme.
