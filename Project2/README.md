Project 2 - Artist's Statement 

"The Children's Entertainment Automated Monitoring Bureau"
by Martin Hanses



The immediate response to the essay was a curiosity into the algorithm both creating and recommending these titles. Computers have a fascinating ability to look past our preconceptions and contextual understanding to create things we would never consider, which isn’t in itself inherently good or bad - but in the case of children’s entertainment online, it’s absurdly risky and dangerous. 

I struggled with coming up with an angle to the game, but eventually settled on trying to emphasise the issue in co-operative moderation and curation between man/machine in a production environment that is utterly and undeniably corporate. The gameplay is basically the game suggesting potential video titles (implied to later be turned into actual videos) and the player agreeing or disagreeing to their value or acceptability. Accepting a title is simple - the AI just assumes it did a great job, and sends the accepted title to a list. The point here is to poke fun at the practice of having computers only learn from failure - the condition or context of success is unweighed, and simply filed as the algorithm doing its job. However, should a player attempt to reject a title, the AI will protest, asking for a reason. Not only is this again a reference to computer learning based on failure, but also corporate, profit-driven culture willing to ignore certain issues in the pursuit of efficiency - a quality also highly valued by computers and computer engineers. This was also the reason for the AI becoming impatient with the player, should they keep rejecting titles - human “inefficiency” supposedly “fixed” by the speed and non-discriminatory nature of computational generation, free from the consideration of morals.

The first few tests I ran seemed to create almost too outlandish titles, but after going back to research on that dark corner of YouTube, I found that the titles my program produced were oftentimes *more* coherent than the actual titles found on the website - most of which were just list-like ordeals of popular characters. 

For the actual words, I managed to find a massive list of adjectives - the word I found had the largest impact on player perception - and then wrote down a number of characters, prepositions, endings and nouns to complete the base title sentence. I also chose to add in a few capitalised words, hoping to give the effect of the AI finding them from all sorts of sources and contexts from all over the internet.

The visual design of the AI is really simple - it’s a doodle character I draw a lot. I found, however, that the uniqueness of the little “cat” juxtaposed nicely with the corporate, formal feel of the generic default ResponsiveVoice speaker. For the rest of the design, I was influenced by the case for the Atari 2600 - it lends a sense of being outdated, which I feel in turn adds to the outdated approach of the fictional bureau.

In the end, the game turned out very decent in parodying content generation, and I think - between the players laughing at the strange titles and the same people being shocked at the AI filling in the blanks after their indecisiveness - it invokes certain questions about curation and trust in an algorithm to entertain children. Like comic actor Jim Carrey’s entertainment network programming-brainwashed character famously says in the hit award-winning, much beloved and quoted evergreen social satire “The Cable Guy”,

“Somebody has to kill the baby-sitter.”
